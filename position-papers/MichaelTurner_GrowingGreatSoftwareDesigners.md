### Topic: Growing Great Software Designers 
### Delegate: Michael Turner

### Introduction
My organization has defined numerous work flows and processes to address the topics of software design employee onboarding and advancement over the past few decades.  As expected, numerous failures and successes have been observed.  However, such corporate-level attention provides a good foundation for all software designers to reference.  In addition, the day-to-day guidance and mentoring is provided by the software architects. The combination of organization and peer guidance is the key to the development of strong software designers.

### Things Gone Right
#### Tiered product design
The first tier of design is of the platform that results in reusable mechanical, hardware, and software design assets.  The second tier is the product-specific configuration of the reusable assets.  The 3rd tier of design is the creation of product-specific design assets.  As designers grow their expertise, their role moves up each tier.  Typically, the 1st tier is occupied by architects or the most experienced designers.  By working at the 3rd tier, designers gain experience with the methods used to design the other tiers and receive mentoring and coaching from the designers of the other tiers.
#### Periodic design forums for software design team
For each tier of design, the design team meets weekly to discuss design issues and successes.  The information is cascaded to the other tiers by the software architect.  This process allows designers at each tier to participate in the relevant discussion, as well as get exposure to issues and solutions for other tiers.
#### Teams of technologists
To facilitate mentoring and coaching of design concepts, the formation of teams of technologists is important.  The teams work on various tiers of product design.  In general, a software architect leads the team, with software design champions leading each functional area of the design, and lead developers in charge of the individual feature implementation and testing.  For daily operations, the teams receive direction from the software architect or design champion (depending upon the tier).  This allows the teams to maintain some isolation from the project management with regard to technology, as the product managers are lacking in requisite knowledge to make sound design choices.
#### Technical ladder program
The technical ladder program is an organizational structure that allows technical experts an opportunity for a career advancement in parallel to a management path.  Each rung of the ladder is obtained by demonstrating more advanced levels of expertise in a given field (e.g., software architecture, software design).  The first rung is occupied by software designers who have demonstrated and are recognized for their expertise of a given domain or functional area.  The next rung is occupied by software architects and designers who are recognized as mentors and have some external recognition.  Thus, all software engineering personnel have a list of experts that they can consult for assistance with design concepts, as it is expected that the ladder members are aware of and enforce established and accepted design principles.  In addition, the engineers are motivated to achieve expertise to obtain a position on the ladder.
#### Standardized software design processes
Our organization has a verbose software development process that includes numerous design processes.  Each designer is required to utilize the established processes and template, or they must provide a tailoring process with justification for the deviations.  A few examples of the design processes are:
- Software Bill Of Material
	- List of the software components, status (new, leveraged, reused), location (CM) and supplier
- Impact analysis/effort estimation techniques
- Templates for architecture and design documentation
- Design checklists for each level of design

### Things Gone Wrong
#### Knowledge debt
The product complexity is increasing rapidly. In addition, design cycle times are decreasing.  The factors have created issues for the organization with regard to roles and responsibilities.  That is, the organizational definition of the architect and designer roles is not modified as quickly as the actual roles are.  Thus, educating new designers and keeping responsibilities consistent among the organization is becoming difficult.  
  
Another effect of the increase in complexity is the difficulty for architects and design champions to stay current with knowledge of software and product domains.  While the organization seems to be capable of training designers on product domain knowledge, the expertise does not exist to provide internal training on modern software design concepts.  
  
Another form of knowledge debt is due to the various software design concepts utilized within the organization.  Due to the complexity and breadth of the product lines offered, software designers may be required to understand cloud computing, high speed networking, real-time firmware systems, cyber security, big data, and other varied technologies.  Several of these technologies may exist within the same product.  It is becoming increasing difficult to ensure designers have the requisite knowledge to be assigned to the appropriate technology, as the design concepts may differ.
	
#### Process debt
Examples of our organizational processes that did/do not match with modern practices are:
- A 5-day class for new hires to explain software design process
	- It was too-much-too-soon, instead of just-in-time knowledge
- Conflict between newer concepts and "traditional practices" 
	- Waterfall vs agility
	- Just-in-time architecture vs big-bang
	- Just-in time architecture/agility is in contrast to architectural needs for our tiered product design
	- Difficult to balance rigidity of corporate software processes and agility
- Architectural road map is too short
	- Architectural needs are established after project is awarded

#### Organizational debt
The corporation has a mature and experienced management team.  However, this team was established when the focus of the company was on products containing a large portion of mechanical and electrical assets, with a small amount of software for control.  Over the last few years, the company has pivoted to a software-centric focus, even offering consulting services to our customers.  However, a corresponding pivot of the management team did not occur.  This has led to a lack of managers with the requisite knowledge to lead and/or contribute on software design.  The result is a strain on the architects and designers to fill the gaps.  

Additionally, due to the growth of the global footprint of the organization's software engineering team, it has become increasing difficult to develop design practices that are accepted and understood by the regionally educated designers.  The root cause of this is the differences in the formal education received in various countries, as well as the cultural beliefs regarding needs for standardization.

### Summary
The challenge of developing great software designers is significant, as the root causes for the deficiencies are numerous and varied per organization and region.  However, establishing a team of software technologists who operate with some autonomy to solve the issues is more effective that mandates from product management or process development teams.
